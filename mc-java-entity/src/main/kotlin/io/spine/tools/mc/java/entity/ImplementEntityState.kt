/**
 * Updates the Java code of a message type which qualifies as [EntityState] by
 * making it implement this interface.
 *
 * The class is public because its fully qualified name is used as a default
 * value in [EntitySettings][io.spine.tools.mc.java.gradle.settings.EntitySettings].
 *
 * ## Implementation note
 *
 * The class descends from [DirectMessageAction] and delegates to [ImplementInterface] in
 * the [doRender] method instead of extending [ImplementInterface] directly.
 * This is so because of the following.
 * The resolution of the ID field type requires an instance of
 * [TypeSystem][io.spine.protodata.type.TypeSystem].
 * The field type is passed as the generic parameter of the [EntityState] interface.
 * The [typeSystem] property is not yet initialized when the constructor is called.
 * Therefore, we have to use delegation rather than inheritance here.
 *
 * @param type The type of the message.
 * @param file The source code to which the action is applied.
 * @param context The code generation context in which this action runs.
