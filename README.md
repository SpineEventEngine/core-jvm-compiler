This repository hosts the plugins to the Spine Compiler that the Core JVM library offers for
building a client or a server application.

### Environment

The modules in this repository are built with Java 17.

### Performance testing

This repo includes the `BuildSpeed` submodule with the performance tests for the Spine tools.
The tests are executed in a GH Action. To run the tests locally, launch the `checkPerformance`
Gradle task. The task execution time will be printed to the console, and 
the [journal file](./BuildSpeed/journal.log) will be updated.
