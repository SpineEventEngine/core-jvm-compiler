/**
 * A ProtoData plugin which annotates Java code with API level annotations that match
 * the API level options defined in Protobuf files.
 *
 * Spine SDK defines two ways for defining API level stability for the Java code:
 *
 * 1. **API level annotations for Java classes** such as
 * [Beta][io.spine.annotation.Beta] or [Internal][io.spine.annotation.Internal].
 * These annotations are used for the handcrafted code.
 * Please see `io.spine.annotation` package for details.
 *
 * 2. **API level options for Protobuf types.** These options are used
 * defined in the `options.proto` file, which is likely to be imported by most of
 * the Protobuf files of a Spine-based application.
 * These options result in annotations in the generated code.
 *
 * The file `options.proto` defines options for files, message types, fields, and services which
 * serve the same purpose as the API level annotations for Java classes.
 *
 * This plugin annotates the Java code produced by the Protobuf compiler, taking into account
 * options discovered in corresponding definitions.
 *
 * @see ApiOption
